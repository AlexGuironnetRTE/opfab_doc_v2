== Conventions regarding project structure and configuration

Sub-projects must conform to a few rules in order for the configured Gradle
tasks to work:

=== Java

[horizontal]
[sub-project]/src/main/java:: contains java source code
[sub-project]/src/test/java:: contains java tests source code
[sub-project]/src/main/resources:: contains resource files
[sub-project]/src/test/resources:: contains test resource files

=== Modeling

Core services projects declaring REST APIS that use Swagger for their
definition must declare two files:

[horizontal]
[sub-project]/src/main/modeling/swagger.yaml:: Swagger API definition
[sub-project]/src/main/modeling/config.json:: Swagger generator configuration

=== Docker

Services project all have docker image generated in their build cycle (See
<<Gradle Tasks>>).

Per project configuration :

* docker file : *[sub-project]/src/main/docker/Dockerfile*
* docker-compose file : *[sub-project]/src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml*
* runtime data : *[sub-project]/src/main/docker/volume* is copied to
*[sub-project]/build/docker-volume/* by task *copyWorkingDir*. The latest
can then be mounted as volume in docker containers.
