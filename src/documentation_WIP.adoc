:imagesdir: {gradle-rootdir}/src/docs/asciidoc/images

//TODO Explain how documentation is organized and conventions, how to generate it
Write docs with level 1 title (so they can be used on their own) + level offset (except for really short bits)

All includes are defined based on root dir

asciidoctor index.adoc -a imagesdir=images


using custom ids : cumbersome but
1) you get a warning if duplicates rather than silently link to the wrong section
2) easier to find referenced text (ctrl-f on id)
3) it's a sign that the content is referenced somewhere else (if you're thinking of deleting/moving it)

defining label with the id doesn't work with relative links
[[my_id, text to display]]
