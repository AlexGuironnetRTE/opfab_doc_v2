= Deployment and Administration of OperatorFabric

The aim of this document is to explain how to configure and deploy OperatorFabric.

== Deployment

For now OperatorFabric consist of Docker images available either by compiling
the project or by using images releases from link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub]

Service images are all based on link:https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk[openjdk:8-jdk-alpine].

For simple one instance per service deployment, you can find a sample
deployment as a docker-compose file
link:https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/tree/master/src/main/docker/deploy[here]
//TODO Replace url by relative link or include

To run OperatorFabric in development mode, see link:../dev_env/index.html[the development environment documentation].

== Restricted operations (administration)

Some operations are restricted to users with the **ADMIN** role, either because they are administration
operations with the potential to impact the OperatorFabric instance as a whole, or because they
give access to information that should be private to a user.

Below is a quick recap of these restricted operations.

.Users Service
Any action (read, create/update or delete) regarding a single user's data (their personal info such as their first and
last name, as well as their settings) can be performed either by the user in question or by a user with the ADMIN role.

Any action on a list of users or on the groups (if authorization is managed in OperatorFabric) can only be performed by
a user with the ADMIN role.

.Thirds Service
Any write (create, update or delete) action on bundles can only be performed by a user with the ADMIN role. As such,
administrators are responsible for the quality and security of the provided bundles.
In particular, as it is possible to use scripts in templates, they should perform a security check to make sure that
there is no XSS risk.

.Time Service (for demonstration purposes only)
Any user can get the current state of simulated time but acting on it (changing the speed of time flow, setting
the reference for simulated time or resetting it entirely) requires the ADMIN role.

IMPORTANT: The ADMIN role doesn't grant any special privileges when it comes to card consultation (be they current or
archived), so an user with the ADMIN role will only see cards that have been addressed to them or to one of their
groups), just like any other user.
